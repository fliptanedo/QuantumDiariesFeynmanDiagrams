# QuantumDiariesFeynmanDiagrams
Archive of US/LHC (later Quantum Diaries) blog series on Feynman Diagrams

[Original posts](https://www.quantumdiaries.org/2010/02/14/lets-draw-feynman-diagams/) are now on Quantum Diaries, but the site is no longer being maintained (as of 2016) and many of the image links are broken. 

## Fixing links

You can manually fix links by changing `http://blogs.uslhc.us/` to `https://www.quantumdiaries.org/` everywhere in the html. 

## A stop gap archive

This repository is archive of my Feynman Diagram posts in `.webarchive` (Safari) format. Eventually I would like to do another round of revisions and repost these somewhere.

## YMMV

This repository is for preservation purposes. Some have found these posts useful Your mileage may vary! There may be errors, typos, mistakes, gross misstatements.
